        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hi, I'm Johan Francois Norman, a beginner web developer with a passion for creating beautiful and functional websites.<br>
            I like to think of myself as someone with a creative mind and if I like somthing I will find out how to do it if I don't know how.<br>
            I like to imagine someting coming to life and have the power to attract and show people something to look forward to.<br>
            I love to play games because it keeps my creative brain going and keeps my imagination fresh.<br>
            I am currently looking for a a job as an intern for web development.
